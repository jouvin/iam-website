title: IAM account API
---

IAM provides a RESTful API that can be used to manage users, group membership, clients, etc.

IAM implements the following endpoints:
* ```/iam/account/{id}/attributes```, providing access to user attributes
* ```/iam/account/{id}/authorities```, providing access to user authorities/roles
* ```/iam/account/me/clients```, providing access to clients owned by the user
* ```/iam/account/find/{option}```, searching users by username/label/e-mail/group/certificate subject
* ```/iam/account/{id}/groups/{groupId}```, providing access to user groups
* ```/iam/account/{id}/managed-groups```, providing access to groups to which a user is manager
* ```/iam/group/{groupId}/group-managers```, listing managers of a certain group
* ```/iam/account/{id}/labels```, providing access to user account labels
* ```/iam/account/{id}/endTime```, managing user membership end time
* ```/iam/account/me/proxycert```, managing user proxy certificate
* ```/iam/account/search```, listing user accounts
* ```/iam/group/search```, listing all groups

Authentication is required in all the endpoints and the access is based on IAM roles.
Remember that there are three roles in Indigo IAM: Amdin, User, Group Manager.

## User attributes

### GET `/iam/account/{id}/attributes`

Retrieves user attributes. The {id} refers to the account identifier.

Requires that the Access Token contains the restricted System Scope `iam:admin.read`, or the token subject is the one represented by the {id}.

```bash
$ curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AT}" \
  http://localhost:8080/iam/account/80e5fb8d-b7c8-451a-89ba-346ae278a66f/attributes | jq
[
  {
    "name": "Nickname",
    "value": "Test"
  }
]
```

### PUT `/iam/account/{id}/attributes`

Adds attributes to the user account. It can be done directly through the IAM dashboard by clicking on "Set attribute" button in *Attributes* section of the user homepage.

Requires `iam:admin.write` scope.

```bash
$ curl -X PUT -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AT}" -d @attribute.json \
  http://localhost:8080/iam/account/80e5fb8d-b7c8-451a-89ba-346ae278a66f/attributes
```

where ```attribute.json``` is:

```json
{
   "name":"Nickname",
   "value":"Test"
}
```

### DELETE `/iam/account/{id}/attributes`

Deletes user attribute by adding the query parameter at the end of the endpoint.

Requires `iam:admin.write` scope.

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AT}" \
  http://localhost:8080/iam/account/80e5fb8d-b7c8-451a-89ba-346ae278a66f/attributes?name=Nickname
```

## User roles

### GET `/iam/account/{id}/authorities`

Retrieves user roles.

Requires `iam:admin.read` scope.

```bash
$ curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AT}" \
  http://localhost:8080/iam/account/80e5fb8d-b7c8-451a-89ba-346ae278a66f/authorities | jq
{
  "authorities": [
    "ROLE_GM:c617d586-54e6-411d-8e38-649677980001",
    "ROLE_USER"
  ]
}
```

The above example shows that the Test User is also a group manager (of group with ```c617d586-54e6-411d-8e38-649677980001``` id).

### POST `/iam/account/{id}/authorities`

Adds an authority to the user.

Requires `iam:admin.write` scope.

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AT}" -d "authority=ROLE_ADMIN" \
  http://localhost:8080/iam/account/80e5fb8d-b7c8-451a-89ba-346ae278a66f/authorities
```

### DELETE `/iam/account/{id}/authorities`

Revokes user authority by specifying the query parameter.

Requires `iam:admin.write` scope.

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AT}" \
  http://localhost:8080/iam/account/80e5fb8d-b7c8-451a-89ba-346ae278a66f/authorities?authority=ROLE_ADMIN
```

## Managed clients

### GET `/iam/account/me/clients`

      ],
      "scope": "address phone openid profile offline_access read-tasks attr write-tasks email read:/ write:/",
